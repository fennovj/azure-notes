# Preface

Considering I covered a lot of these basics already during AZ-204, this folder is a lot smaller. Also, DP-201 is much more in-depth than AZ-204, about fewer topics. It is mainly CosmosDB, Data Lake, Synapse, with a little Stream Analytics, Data Factory and Data Bricks. But it goes much deeper than the learning path. So most of the in-depth content goes in the 'dp_201_exam' folder.

Also of note is that while studying for this exam, I was doing a project where I worked a lot with Data Factory and Data Bricks. So I felt confident about that part (especially since they are two of the less in-depth topics), so it's possible it is documented here a bit less, since I didn't need to study it much.
