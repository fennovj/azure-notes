# Introduction to machine learning with Python and Azure Notebooks

In general, this learning path spends a lot of time explaining what a Linear Regression is, how to use Pandas, what a Machine Learning model is, etcetera. So I'm not going to make notes about that since I already know that stuff.

Azure Notebooks provide Jupyter as a service for free. It's a convenient way to build notebooks and share them with others without having to install and manage a Jupyter server. And it's web-based, making it an ideal solution for collaborating online. Start here: <https://notebooks.azure.com/>.

It's a relatively easy to use interface, although no jupyter hub :(

You can also make a notebook public, and share the link with others.

Also one thing I didn't know is that Keras is a wrapper around Tensorflow, but also Microsoft Cognitive toolkit.
