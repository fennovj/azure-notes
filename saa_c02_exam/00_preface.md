# AWS Solutions Architect Associate

It has been a while since the Azure exams, mostly because in my new role at Eneco, exams weren't as vital compared to a consultancy role, I was learning AWS on the job, and I didn't have Ruud in my ear motivating me to get certified :)

I found I had less difficulty with the cloud concepts and actual reading documentation, which is a good feeling, but comparatively more effort with learning all the new services. Beyond just the basics like RDS/EC2/ECS, there are many smaller services I hadn't heard of. However, practice exams went well, even without studying, I was already scoring ~75% on the practice exams. Therefore, I decided to mainly focus on listing all the services I didn't know, and just keep doing practice exams until I felt confident in passing.

However, I did need to pay special attention to the topic of moving from on-premise to AWS, e.g. database or storage. This is something I have no experience with, and there are many different services for different usecases, e.g. disk storage, moving databases without downtime, or even just a plain old site-to-site connection.
